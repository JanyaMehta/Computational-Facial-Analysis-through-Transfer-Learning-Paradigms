Computational Facial Analysis through Transfer Learning Paradigms

=>Developed real-time facial emotion recognition system using TensorFlow, Python, and OpenCV.
=>Explored transfer learning to optimize classification and reduce training time, implementing MobileNet with customizations for seven classes.
=>Created training data function and reshaped inputs, adjusting output layers for transfer learning.
=>Utilized softmax activation and sparse categorical cross entropy loss for multi-class classification, integrating pre-trained face detection algorithm for accurate real-time recognition and emotion detection.
